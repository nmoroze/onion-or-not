# Onion or Not?

Onion or Not? is a fun game that challenges you to decide whether a ridiculous headline is from the Onion or not. Once you've made your choice, click the corresponding button and you can find out if you're right or wrong. Onion headlines are sourced from the [Onion Daily news](http://theonion.com), and the real "news" headlines are obtained from submissions to ["Not the Onion" on Reddit](http://reddit.com/r/nottheonion).
